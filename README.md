# Spam Classification

### Summary:
Create text classification model on defining whether the text is spam or not. Deploy the model using FastAPI. This is the first attempt to use FastAPI to create ML API with AWS Stack and Python, to create a simple text classification model for Spam / No Spam. 

### Objectives:
1. Learn text classification processes
2. Learn to use AWS S3 storage to store the text data
3. Learn to use NLP processes, like preprocessing and tokenization
4. Learn to use Keras to build LSTM models for Spam classification
5. Creat API for the model artifacts and deploy to AWS S3
